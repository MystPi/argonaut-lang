# Argonaut-Lang
The Argonaut Programming Language


Argonaut is my first programming language, made with the **ply** python library. Since it's my first language, it's *very* bad and should not be looked at let alone used. ðŸ¤£

## Here's the documentation anyway:
<br>

>### Comments:
```
[- comment -]

[- Comments
are always
multi-line -]
```
>### I/O:
```
log(...);
input(...);
```
>### Variables:
```
var -> 12;
log(var);
```
>### Math:
```js
5 + 2 = 7
5 - 2 = 3
5 * 2 = 10
5 / 2 = 2.5
5 ^ 2 = 25
5 % 2 = 1
```
>### Conditions:
```js
5 == 2 : false
5 != 2 : true
5 > 2  : true
5 < 2  : false

and or not
```
>### If / OWise:
```
if (condition) {
  ...
}
	
if (condition) {
  ...
} owise {
  ...
}
```
>### Loops:
```
loop (expression) {
  ...
}
```
>### Creating/Calling Functions:
Super basic, no arguments.
```
fun (funcName) (returnExpr) {
  ...
}

(fun);
```
>### Built-in functions:
There are basically none:
```
log(...); [- Already covered -]
input(...); [- Already covered -]
toInt(...); [- Converts the argument to an integer value -]
```
